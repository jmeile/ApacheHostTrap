#This file contains a list of the banned hosts and also a list of the whitelisted
#ones. It has the following format: <ip_address> (allow)|(deny epoch_seconds)
#Where:
#* allow will whitelist an ip. So no checks will be done here.
#* deny epoch_seconds: this indicates that the ip will be banned an the epoch
#  seconds is the time when the ban occured.
#You may take a look at the file: blacklisted_hosts_full.txt to see what a host
#was trying to access when it got banned

#Whitelists the archive.org bot
207.241.231.170 allow
207.241.229.237 allow
