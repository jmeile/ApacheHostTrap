#Here I will block common WordPress vulnerabilities, ie: access to the
#xmlrpc.php file, which can be used by some plugins, but it is advisable to
#disable it

#Make sure to include this file after your CustomLog directive; otherwise the
#request of the blocked host won't be registered into the apache's log file

#For use instructions, see the evil_host_trap_init.conf file.

#Conditions for WordPress websites. Here you can add more rules by adding
#the [OR] operator at the end
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^(.*)xmlrpc(.*)$ [NC]
